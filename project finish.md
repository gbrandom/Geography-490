## Development of National Lightning Detection Network 



1. **General statements**
	1. The first is it is well documented how the network is set up.This  
	2. The goal of this project would be to learn how to rank data quality for usability with just the data given 
3. **data sources**
	* NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information lightning catalog
		1. Count  per Year 
			1. 1986-2012
		2. Count by per month 
			1. January and July  for list years aboves
		2. count by hour per year 
			1. Hours 20 for year 1986 -2012

2. **Usefulness of this data**
	* The Catalog was highly useful to the project 
		* The variety of how the data was broken up in the catalog aloud for me to compare it in a handful of ways.
		* How they Divided it up
			1. Count by Hour per Month
			2. Count by Hour per Year
			3. Count per Day
			4. Count per month 
			5. Count per year
			
			**Note** each option also has positive polarity data as well 

1. **Looking at the data**

	Looking at this first photo shows what looks like a lack of data  west of the missippi. Before one can conclude that there is not data there you have to compare several years.
